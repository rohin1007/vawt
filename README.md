# Vertical Axis Wind Turbine

Numerical modelling of Vertical Axis Wind Turbine(VAWT) using ANSYS Fluent Solver. It is based on an online tutorial by Cornell University https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=333371302

Velocity magnitude contour was generated and the results are as expected. A large recirculation zone is seen in the wake of the turbine blade which is perpendicular to the flow. This can have a negative impact on the performance of neighbouring VAWTs. Turbulent kinetic energy contour shows the regions where there are large changes in velocity. Mainly, vortices are generated starting from the blade tip.
